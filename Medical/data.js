In   long bone it forms the diaphysis.  The secondary centers of ossification   usually appear after birth and form small parts of the bone called   epiphyses.  Law of ossification states that   secondary centres of ossification which appear first are last to   unite.  The growing end of the long bone is that   end of the bone whose epiphysis fuses with the diaphysis (shaft) later than   the other end. It lies opposite to the direction of nutrient   foramen.\n\r\n\r\n\rLong Bone          \n\r  Adult long bone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                                   \n\r\n\r  \n\r    Shaft:                           \n\r      Periosteum: outer       fibrous layer and an inner cellular layer osteogenic in nature, united to       the underlying bone by Sharpey\'s fibres,&nbsp;

\n\r  Articular surfaces are covered with hyaline   (articular) cartilage.                        Between the articular surfaces there is a joint cavity filled with   synovial fluid which lubricates the joint and nourishes the articular   cartilage.                        The joint is surrounded by an articular capsule which is made up of a   fibrous capsule lined by synovial membrane.                        The synovial membrane lines whole of the interior of the joint, except   for the articular surfaces covered by hyaline cartilage                        Capsule and ligaments possess a rich nerve supply, which makes them   acutely sensitive to pain.                        The synovial membrane has a poor nerve supply and is relatively   insensitive to pain.                        The articular cartilage is non-nervous and totally   insensitive.                        Hilton\'s law states that a motor nerve to the muscle acting on joint   tends to give a branch to that joint (capsule) and another branch to the skin   covering the joint.                 \n\r\n\r\n\rClassification of muscles\n\r  According   to structure\n\r\n\r\n\r              \n\r\n\rStriated/Skeletal          \n\r\n\rNon-striated/Visceral/Smooth          \n\r\n\rCardiac&nbsp;      Attached to the     skeleton&nbsp;        Related to the     viscera&nbsp;        Wall of   heart&nbsp;&nbsp;         Fibres unbranched&nbsp;      Fibres unbranched&nbsp;      Fibres branched&nbsp;        Light and dark bands       present&nbsp;         Light and dark bands absent         Faint light and dark bands       present&nbsp;&nbsp;              No intercalated disc&nbsp;       No intercalated disc&nbsp;    Intercalated disc       present&nbsp;&nbsp;      They soon get fatigued&nbsp;&nbsp;    They do not get fatigued&nbsp;&nbsp;    They never get fatigued&nbsp;&nbsp;      Voluntary&nbsp;    Involuntary&nbsp;    Involuntary&nbsp;\n\r\n\r¥ Endomysium surrounds each muscle fibre separately.

The infiltration of the lactiferous duct   and their consequent fibrosis leads to retraction of the nipple.                     Secondary breast cancer are usually   lodged in the liver, ovaries or the peritoneum making the prognosis worse.                        The cancer cells may migrate   transcelomically to ovary producing a secondary tumour called Krukenberg   tumour.                    &nbsp;Peau d\'orange: In breast cancer,   the skin over the breast presents an orange peel appearance.
