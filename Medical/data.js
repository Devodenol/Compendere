In   long bone it forms the diaphysis.  The secondary centers of ossification   usually appear after birth and form small parts of the bone called   epiphyses.  Law of ossification states that   secondary centres of ossification which appear first are last to   unite.  The growing end of the long bone is that   end of the bone whose epiphysis fuses with the diaphysis (shaft) later than   the other end. It lies opposite to the direction of nutrient   foramen.\n\r\n\r\n\rLong Bone                                         \n\r  Adult long bone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                                   \n\r\n\r  \n\r    Shaft:                           \n\r      Periosteum: outer       fibrous layer and an inner cellular layer osteogenic in nature, united to       the underlying bone by Sharpey\'s fibres,&nbsp;

                       \n\r  Articular surfaces are covered with hyaline   (articular) cartilage.                        Between the articular surfaces there is a joint cavity filled with   synovial fluid which lubricates the joint and nourishes the articular   cartilage.                        The joint is surrounded by an articular capsule which is made up of a   fibrous capsule lined by synovial membrane.                        The synovial membrane lines whole of the interior of the joint, except   for the articular surfaces covered by hyaline cartilage                        Capsule and ligaments possess a rich nerve supply, which makes them   acutely sensitive to pain.                        The synovial membrane has a poor nerve supply and is relatively   insensitive to pain.                        The articular cartilage is non-nervous and totally   insensitive.                        Hilton\'s law states that a motor nerve to the muscle acting on joint   tends to give a branch to that joint (capsule) and another branch to the skin   covering the joint.                      \n\r","Bones & Joints","topics\\Bones_&_Joints.htm","\n\r  Cardiovascular system is the transport   system of the body, through which the nutrients are conveyed to places where   these are utilized, and the metabolites (waste products) are conveyed to   appropriate places from where these are expelled.                                            Lymphatic system is essentially a   drainage system which is accessory to the venous system. Most of the tissue   fluid formed at the arterial end of capillaries is absorbed back into the   blood by the venous ends of the capillaries and the postcapillary venules.
